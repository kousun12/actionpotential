# actionpotential

Made as an installation for a [vyvn](http://vyvn.com/) party. three.js environment intended to run over 3d camera data provided by an XBox Kinect. Extracts 3d skeletal positons of people in a room and creates a real-time visual interpretation of social dance. Unfortunately, there are no videos of this in action, you had to be there.
